# Civic-Innovation-Day
Civic Innovation Day is an annual day long event designed to bring together designers, developers, technologists, enthusiasts, citizens and public servants to discuss and work on problems that face our community. It's part hackathon and part workshop.

We believe that combining technology and human expertise we can improve our community.  Central Virginia is home to a highly educated and active citizenry that should be engaged deeply to help make our community a better place to live.

# Code of Conduct
[Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) has developed a [code of conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct/blob/master/README.md) and an anti-harassment policy for this type of event.  We intend to use it as a guide to ensure our event remains positive, welcoming, and accepting.
